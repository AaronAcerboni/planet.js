#Planet.js#

Planet.js is a JavaScript data aggregator in the spirit of Planet software. It aims to be a server environment for creating and managing sites which are data driven.

The magic of planet.js is the ability to synchronise a variety of data ranging from standard RSS to any old web service. Possible use cases are for community sites, sticking your blogs together or anything else you want to hack together with data sources.

Versatility is a philosophy planet.js wants to abide by. This means various ways of getting hold of data, various ways of manipulating it and various ways of outputting it.
