> # Planet JS
> Planet JS is a JavaScript RSS & ATOM feed aggregator which developers may use to build their own Planet Sites.  
> In time Planet JS will aim to also provide plugins and themes to enhance websites built with Planet JS. All accessible from an admin/configuration panel.  
Expect this README to get a bit bulkier as time goes on.
