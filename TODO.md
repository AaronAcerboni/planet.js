# TODO

## General

- Conintue revision planet.js backend before focusing on routing and view components.
- `Activities` should be able to read the OAuth syntax from `aggregations.json` and act appropriately.
- Evaluate code in level of asynchronicity.

## Processing

- Processing modules for flickr.

## Activities

- Give `Poller` and `Subscriber` activities a common parent object and diversify them using some inheritance.

## Log

- Log should output to a file and not just the console. This is low priority.
