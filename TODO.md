# TODO

## General
- `Activities` should be able to read the OAuth syntax from `aggregations.json` and act appropriately.
- Processing modules for flickr, twitter etc.

## Fetch
- Create functionality for allowing Socket connections to be used by the still to come `Subscriber` activity.

## Activities
- Create a `Subscriber` activity. It will have similar behaviour to the `Poller` but perhaps it could have a listening socket open for data.

## Log
- Log should output to a file and not just the console.
